    "## 1 There can be only one (Python environment)\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually that is not true, there are and can be many Python environments.  There are so many options for using Python that it becomes a burden of choice for new users, and most regular users will choose different environments to fit different simple, common tasks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We might quickly make a comparison with using the `R` programming language.  For typical `R` use we can just \"install and go\" and we do not need to think about computer software and hardware \"system administration\".  When using `R` most people:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the newest version of `R` possible\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the same editor, probably `RStudio`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Obtain packages from the exact same repository, `CRAN` (the Comprehensive R Archive Network)\n",
    "\n",
    "- `R` package version management is largely unnecessary\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write and run `R` code on our local computer with no setup or configuration required\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is different, because system adminsitration in some form is often required, even for basic use.  In Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We must pay attention to our Python version (major version 2, major version 3, version 3.7 or higher, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are MANY editors, like IDLE, Spyder, RStudio, Jupyter notebooks, and so many more\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python libraries (exactly like R packages) come from several major repositories and version intercompaibility is *ahem* challenging\n",
    "\n",
    "- We must actively manage library versions (this requires moderate to great practice)\n",
    "\n",
    "- We often write and run code locally, on edge devices, or in the cloud depending on our need or application\n",
    "\n",
    "- Many cloud options for running Python exist, each with pros and cons (Google Colab, Kaggle, Amazon Sagemaker Studio Lab, many others); of course more advanced management options exist too\n",

    "### 2.1 Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda is software designed to manage different environments for Python (and other software), libraries and editors.  It is popular because it is easy to use and is free and open source.  Part of the Anaconda ecosystem is the Python repository `conda`.\n",

    "B. Click Create +\n",
    "\n",
    "C. Name your new environment something sensible\n",
    "\n",
    "D. I recommend starting with Python 3.7 (the same version as Google Colab as of 2022-10-15)\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have created an environment, you can install Jupyter Lab:\n",

    "\n",
    "A. Click the Home tab\n",

    "### 2.2 Google Colab\n",
    "\n",
    "Using colab requires a Google account, so create one if you do not already have one.  If you do already have one, you will probably want to have some free storage space on your Google Drive space (you have ~15GB for \"free\").  If you do not have enough space for managing some new data to your Google Drive, you might consider making a new google account just for the purpose of using Colab.\n",
